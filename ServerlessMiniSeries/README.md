# Local Serverless Development

This is the repo containing sample code for my Local Serverless Development mini-series.  
This was first published on my [personal blog](https://iamrufio.com)

Each of the individual blog posts will contain all code in a separate directory inside this repo.  
As I publish new posts, the code will be added in a new numerically named folder.

## Part 1

Part 1 covers invoking functions locally.  
[The code can be found here](https://github.com/ianrufus/BlogPosts/tree/master/ServerlessMiniSeries/1)

The code consists of three separate Serverless functions - one each for Python, NodeJS and Java.  
The functions simply print out a name from the supplied event data, and a variable from a provided environment variables file.

## Getting Started

Each of the individual directories contains a README with information on running the code for that specific post.
